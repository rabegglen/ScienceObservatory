Data Compilation &amp; Visualisation of P3 Data from the SNSF

The R Project is intended to compile P3 data from the SNSF into easily importable .json files for a d3.js v5 visualisation for the Open Data course at the University of Bern.

The JS files for the visualisation web application can be found in the folder 'webApp'. The scripts within this folder area are importing data relative to the root of the html file.
